# CovidTracer
It is a simple web application which creates a local server, makes use of multiple web API's and 
is used to view COVID-19 related statistics like Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recovered Cases, that too in
a Country wise format as well as Statewise format but only for Indian states. Further, District wise data for every Indian state
can also be viewed. All the statistics are updated regularly and have been collected from reliable sources.
